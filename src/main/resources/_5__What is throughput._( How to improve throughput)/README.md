# Throughput
============

    The Volume of work or information flowing through a system.

    If I am creating 100 videos in 100 days then my throughput will be 1 video/ per day.

    Throughput is the amount of data transmitted per unit of time. It is the process flow rate.

    Throughput is measured in bits per second i.e bps.


# Throughput Analysis
=====================

   # Monolithic 
        In case of monolithic everything relies in a same system and same code-base. 
        In Monolithic there will be a limited resources.
   



   # Distributed
        In case of distributed all components/elements are distributed over a multiple servers/machines.
        In Distributed there will be a no limited resources.
        1 work i have divided into multiple resources so process will be faster than monolithic.
        WHich means Distributed system throughput would be high because we can use load balance and no limited resources.
        No limit on resources we can scalled horizontally mean we can add on some additional machines.
        Load balancer we can use so it will send the Requests to multiple machines in a round-robin fashions.
   


# Causes of Low Throughput
===========================

   1. Latency

    If Latency will be more then Throughput will be less. 
    
   2. Protocol Overhead

    If there is to and fro communication or handshake communication between 2 servers then Latency will increase 
    and throughput will get decrease.

   3. Congestion

    On a same time a lots of requests is coming then also throughput will become less.



# Improving Throughput
=======================

   1. Use Caching

   2. Use Distributed System instead of Monolithic System

   3. Use CDN (content-delivery-network)

   4. Use Load Balancer

   5. Upgrade your resources
