# What is the System Designed?

    System Design is the process of designing the elements of a system such as the architecture, modules and components,
    the different interfaces of those components and the data that goes through the system.

 # 2-Types of System Design
    
    1. HLD - High Level Design
    2. LLD - Low Level Design

  # HLD 
    Describes the main components that would be developed for the resulting products.

    The System Architecture details, Database design, services and processes, the
  
    relationship between various modules and features.


 # LLD
    Describes the design of each element mentioned in the High-Level Design of the system.

    Classes, Interfaces, relationships between different classes and actual logic of the

    various components. so, In LLD we go inside and write a business logics for our HLD.

    What we have described elements in HLD, so those element actual design described in our LLD.
