   Now What you have to do is every website username and password you must have to REMEMBER, so this is a PROBLEM.

   One more PROBLEM suppose there is one new APPLICATION came tomorrow and a PERSON wants to do SIGN_UP but there 
   are a lots of fields and details to be ENTERED but now PERSON does not want to SIGNUP_UP again and fill all these
   details so, PERSON just wants to CLICK a BUTTON and get SIGNED_UP so now there is 2 PROBLEMS

    1. Many Applications are there and need to remember all Username and Password.

    2. Now second PROBLEM is who is app provider/app developer/app creator facing problem to
       getting sign up from new user because a lots of details need to filled in a FORM and 
       PEOPLES do not wants to filled up.
